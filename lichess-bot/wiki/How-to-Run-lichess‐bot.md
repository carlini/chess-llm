## Running lichess-bot
After activating the virtual environment created in the installation steps (the `source` line for Linux and Macs or the `activate` script for Windows), run
```
python3 lichess-bot.py
```
The working directory for the engine execution will be the lichess-bot directory. If your engine requires files located elsewhere, make sure they are specified by absolute path or copy the files to an appropriate location inside the lichess-bot directory.

To output more information (including your engine's thinking output and debugging information), the `-v` option can be passed to lichess-bot:
```
python3 lichess-bot.py -v
```

If you want to disable automatic logging:
```
python3 lichess-bot.py --disable_auto_logging
```

If you want to record the output to a log file, add the `-l` or `--logfile` along with a file name:
```
python3 lichess-bot.py --logfile log.txt
```

If you want to specify a different config file, add the `--config` along with a file name:
```
python3 lichess-bot.py --config config2.yml
```
